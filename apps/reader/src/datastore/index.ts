The entrance of the cave is flanked by sparse, vibrant green blades of grass that grow in scattered tufts, their delicate tips swaying gently in the breeze. Demen s body is a warm, earthy brown color with a subtle sheen, and its large, round eyes shine like polished onyx. Its antennae, long and slender, twitch slightly as it gazes out at the ponds glassy surface, which reflects the soft, feathery clouds drifting lazily across the sky. The atmosphere is peaceful, with a sense of stillness and anticipation, as if Demen is waiting for something to emerge from the caves depths or watching for a ripple to disturb the ponds mirrored calm.";

Talented crickets play the flute, sing and dance together as the sky gradually brightens.";

The cricket has shiny pincers and sharp, hard claws on its feet. Its wings are long and shiny brown, extending down to its feet. It has two black, crescent-shaped teeth and long, curved antennae on its head.";
